Admin Dashboard Project

This project is an implementation of the Admin Dashboard from The Odin Project. It was designed using CSS Grid and structured to improve my understanding of layout techniques in web development.

## Design Inspiration

This project was inspired by the UI design of video games and the dark aesthetic of the manga/anime Berserk. The inspiration for the styling was taken from a Behance project and adjusted to fit a dashboard interface.
